UNIVERSITÉ DE PARIS
A bit of history
• Can be argued that the first computer was built by Blaise Pascal in 1642 (he 
was 19): Addition, substraction, multiplication and division
• Go see it live (4 at CNAM), check how to operate

UNIVERSITÉ DE PARIS
A bit of history
• One computer = one task
• What we call a program today is embeded in the computer’s architecture
• New task? Need for a new computer
What is a computer (back in the 17th 
century)?
• Became desirable to have a separation between hardware and software:
• Hardware: general, tangible
• Software: specific, abstract

• Built by Konrad Zuse from 1936 to 1938
• Mechanical (no electricity except for the clock)
• Clock speed: 1Hz (!!)
• Programmable through punch cards
• Destroyed in 1943
• Read more about it

• Atanasoff-Berry Computer (1937-1942, US): not programmable
• Colossus (1943, UK): programmable (through cables): used to decrypt 
German’s communications
• ENIAC (1945, US): turing complete, programmable, fast (100KHz!)
Electronical computers

• By the way: at that time, “computer” is a job 
title given to women who operate calculcator

A bit of history
• Computer can quickly run operations -> software becomes possible
• Ada Lovelace sees potential in calculator.
• 1842: she writes an algorithm intended to be run by a machine to compute 
Bernouilli numbers (theoretical software!)
• 1937: Turing publishes an article establishing software theoretically
The software

• 21 June 1948: first software by Tom Kilburn run on the Manchester Baby -> 
looks for the highest factor of 262,144
The software
It took 14.51ms to find the answer 131072

• 1951-1952: A-0 System by Grace Hopper, first 
“compiler”
• 1959: COBOL (COmmon Business Oriented Language) 
is created
• 1966: Apollo Guidance Computer (4th astronaut)
The software
Margaret Hamilton next to the software listing 
produced for the Apollo mission
In 18 years, increasingly complex software 
is used for sensitive applications

UNIVERSITÉ DE PARIS
What could go wrong?
• Increasingly complex software for sensitive applications
• Problems of budget, deadlines, de-bugging, maintenance, …
• There is a need to address these issues:
• 1968: first NATO (OTAN in French) conference on software engineering
• Name coined by Margaret Hamilton
The need for software engineering

UNIVERSITÉ DE PARIS
What could go wrong?
Increasingly large software

Number of lines of code
First software (largest factor of 2**18)

Large softwares are more likely to be given up

What could go wrong?
Different factors
Software Economics and Function Point Metrics: Thirty years of IFPUG Progress 
Casper Jones
• Many sources of defects
• Programming errors are only one of them
• number of Lines Of Code (LOC) / time: bad 
productivity measure
• Strong need to study and improve the other 
parts of a software project
