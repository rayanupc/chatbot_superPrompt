Learned a lot
I'm surprised at how friendly people are and how they genuinely
                            are interested in learning and meeting new friends.

Amazing app
Getting to talk to people in the language that I'm learning makes
                            a big difference! They are so nice and I'm helping them learn English.

Addictive in the best way
I never imagined how much I'd be hooked on HelloTalk. I post in

Great app
You get to read lots of posts written by different people with
                            different backgrounds. I enjoy reading, replying and helping people.

Great place to make friends!
I've been using this app for a week now and I love it! I'm there
                            to practice my Korean and people are very helpful in correcting me.
